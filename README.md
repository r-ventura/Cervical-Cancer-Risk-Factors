# Cervical Cancer Risk Factors Analysis

This project explores the relationship between cervical cancer and demographic, behavioral, and clinical factors using machine learning models to predict the likelihood of a positive diagnostic test. Developed for the *Aprenentatge Autom√†tic I* (Machine Learning I) course at **Universitat Polit√®cnica de Catalunya (UPC)**.

## üìå Project Context

Cervical cancer is a significant global health issue. This study aims to provide valuable insights for early detection, prevention, and intervention by exploring various external factors influencing its appearance.

## üèÜ Main Objectives

* Identify the most important external factors associated with cervical cancer.
* Create accurate models to classify samples as positive or negative for cervical cancer.
* Compare different models to determine the best performer in predicting cervical cancer.

## üìä Dataset Information

The study uses a multivariate dataset covering demographic information, habits, and historical medical records of 858 patients. It was collected at the Hospital Universitario de Caracas in Venezuela. The dataset contains 36 attributes, including numerical and categorical variables, with missing values present.
The original target variables (Hinselmann, Schiller, Cytology, and Biopsy) are diagnostic procedures for cervical cancer detection. For this study, a new binary target variable named `Cancer` was created to indicate a positive diagnosis based on any of these tests.
